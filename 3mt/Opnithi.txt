So for my thesis, my thesis topic is environmental factor controlling the phytoplankton boom in Batong Bay, Phuket. In Batong Bay, have problem when phytoplankton boom, it makes the water is color or smelling and to make effect to nature and tourism. In the picture is an example phytoplankton boom with alga in 5 August 2022 in Batong Bay. The main objective of the thesis is to study the environmental factor controlling the phytoplankton boom in Batong Bay, Phuket. For this thesis, we collect seawater sampling in the summer season, sampling every week, in the rainy season, sampling every two weeks. And when I sampling seawater, I will be collected during the no time. I use 20 microns phytoplankton net to collect the phytoplankton sampling. The results reveal that the ratio of dissolved inorganic phosphorous and dissolved inorganic silicate to dissolved inorganic nitrogen in seawater has increased rapidly in approximately one week prior to the boom of chitosanot and inotogamma. Now, we are in the process of making the report. And I think I will present and submit report in July. Now, we got a paper in a topic, weekly variation of nutrient and the association with phytoplankton boom in urban coastal water of Andaman Sea Coast, a case study in Batong Bay, Phuket. And also, on 23, 24 in March, 2023, we presented my research on the 10 national alga and plankton conference in topic. Let's start off the boom forming diatomic chitosanot to nutrient ratio silicate nitrogen and phosphorous in Batong Bay, Phuket. Thank you, everyone. Thank you very much, Omnithi. That is a good one. You already got the publication. I'm not sure that you do have the plan for your thesis defense. I plan I present and submit report in July. Also, you have a plan already when, I mean the date. So you will have the thesis defense on July then. Thank you very much. And any questions? OK. Oh, so no more questions. So we will move to the next.
