## Potential Issues & Recommendations

### Minor Issues Found:

1. **Color notation inconsistency**
   - Location: Slide 430, Connected Papers description
   - Issue: States "Darker = Recent" which may be confusing
   - Recommendation: Verify color coding explanation

2. **Exercise timing tight**
   - Module 2, Exercise 3: 20 minutes for synthesis may be ambitious
   - Recommendation: Facilitator should be ready to extend if needed

3. **Dataset simplicity**
   - research_productivity.csv has clean, well-behaved data
   - Recommendation: Mention to participants that real data is messier

### Suggestions for Facilitator:

1. **Test Slidev presentation** before workshop
2. **Have backup slides** in PDF format
3. **Pre-load all websites** in browser tabs
4. **Practice timing** with a pilot run
5. **Prepare example outputs** for each exercise
