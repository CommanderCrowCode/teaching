## Exercise 3: Literature Synthesis Paragraph (10 minutes)

### Provided Paper Information
Use these three papers for your synthesis exercise:

**Paper 1:** Smith et al. (2023) - "Digital transformation in academic research"
- Finding: AI tools increase research productivity by 45%
- Method: Survey of 500 researchers
- Limitation: Self-reported data

**Paper 2:** Chen & Kumar (2023) - "Ethical considerations in AI-assisted research"
- Finding: 73% of journals now have AI disclosure policies
- Method: Content analysis of 200 journal guidelines
- Concern: Lack of standardization

**Paper 3:** Johnson (2024) - "Quality metrics for AI-generated academic content"
- Finding: AI-assisted papers show equal citation rates
- Method: Bibliometric analysis of 10,000 papers
- Implication: Quality not compromised

### Synthesis Prompt Template
```
Synthesize these three abstracts into a coherent paragraph that:
1. Introduces the theme of AI in academic research
2. Integrates findings from all three papers
3. Identifies the tension between productivity and ethics
4. Concludes with a research gap related to [YOUR SPECIFIC AREA]
5. Uses proper academic citation style (Author, Year)
6. Maintains objective, scholarly tone
Length: 150-200 words
```

## Tips for Success

### ChatGPT vs Claude Selection
- **Use ChatGPT when:**
  - Brainstorming initial ideas
  - Generating multiple variations
  - Need creative approaches
  
- **Use Claude when:**
  - Require precise academic language
  - Working with complex arguments
  - Need longer, detailed outputs

### Iteration Strategies
1. Start broad, then narrow focus
2. Generate multiple versions, combine best elements
3. Use "Continue" for extended outputs
4. Ask for specific improvements
5. Verify all factual claims

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ❌ Accepting first output without revision
- ❌ Forgetting to specify citation style
- ❌ Using overly general prompts
- ❌ Not checking for AI hallucinations
- ❌ Losing your academic voice

### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Accurate representation of concepts
- [ ] Appropriate academic tone
