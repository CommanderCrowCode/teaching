# Content Development Notes: AI Research Tools Workshop

## Facilitator Preparation Guide

### Technical Setup Requirements
- **Primary Tools:** ChatGPT, Claude, Connected Papers, Julius AI (all with test accounts)
- **Backup Accounts:** 2-3 extra logins for each tool in case participants have issues
- **Screen Setup:** Dual monitor recommended - one for presentation, one for monitoring chat
- **Browser Tabs:** Pre-opened and logged into all tools
- **Downloads Ready:** Sample dataset, prompt templates, resource links

### Content Delivery Strategies

#### Pacing Guidelines
- **2-Minute Rule:** No explanation segment longer than 2 minutes without interaction
- **Exercise Timers:** Visible countdown timers for all activities
- **Buffer Time:** 2-3 minutes built into each module for technical issues
- **Catch-up Moments:** Designated points where strugglers can rejoin

#### Engagement Techniques
1. **Name Recognition:** Call out participants who share insights
2. **Success Celebrations:** Acknowledge each completed exercise
3. **Problem Positioning:** Frame each tool as solving their stated challenges
4. **Peer Learning:** Breakout rooms every 20-30 minutes

### Module-Specific Teaching Notes

#### Module 1: AI Writing Assistants
**Critical Success Factors:**
- Show clear before/after examples
- Address AI detection concerns upfront
- Emphasize human expertise remains essential
- Keep first prompt simple for confidence building

**Common Stumbling Blocks:**
- Over-complex initial prompts
- Forgetting to specify format/length
- Not iterating on outputs
- Confusion between ChatGPT/Claude interfaces

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Have "rescue prompts" ready for stuck participants
- Share your own failed prompts as learning examples
- Emphasize iteration over perfection

#### Module 2: Literature Discovery
**Critical Success Factors:**
- Visual learning emphasized
- Clear paper selection criteria
- Integration with Module 1 skills
- Real research application

**Common Stumbling Blocks:**
- Overwhelming visualization
- No good seed paper
- Selection paralysis
- Technical access issues

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Provide 5-10 backup seed papers across disciplines
- Show "messy" real examples, not just clean ones
- Guide interpretation of sparse vs dense networks

#### Module 3: Data Analysis
**Critical Success Factors:**
- Simple dataset that works for all disciplines
- Natural language focus (not coding)
- Immediate visual gratification
- Publication-ready outputs

**Common Stumbling Blocks:**
- Data format issues
- Statistical interpretation confusion
- Over-ambitious analyses
- Export/download problems

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Test dataset with all variable types
- Prepare "statistical translation" phrases
- Show journal-specific formatting examples

#### Module 4: Integration
**Critical Success Factors:**
- Practical, not theoretical
- Personal commitment crucial
- Peer accountability built in
- Resources for continued learning

**Common Stumbling Blocks:**
- Overwhelm from too many tools
- Unclear next steps
- Institutional barriers
- Ethical concerns

**Facilitator Tips:**
- Start with ONE tool integration
- Address institutional policies directly
- Share success stories from similar researchers

### Exercise Design Principles

#### Exercise Scaffolding
1. **Demonstration** → Guided Practice → Independent Application
2. **Simple** → Complex → Creative
3. **Individual** → Peer Review → Group Share

#### Success Criteria for Each Exercise
- Clear, achievable in time given
- Uses participant's actual research
- Produces tangible output
- Builds on previous learning

### Differentiation Strategies

#### For Different Disciplines
- **STEM:** Emphasize data analysis, statistical rigor
- **Humanities:** Focus on synthesis, argumentation
- **Social Sciences:** Balance qualitative/quantitative
- **Professional Fields:** Application and practice examples

#### For Different Experience Levels
- **Beginners:** Extra templates, paired support
- **Intermediate:** Challenge variations offered
- **Advanced:** Leadership roles in breakouts

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: "Will journals reject my paper if I use AI?"**
A: Most journals now accept AI use with disclosure. Show examples of journal policies.

**Q: "How do I avoid plagiarism?"**
A: AI assists, never replaces. Always verify, cite, and maintain your voice.

**Q: "What if my institution doesn't allow these tools?"**
A: Check policies first. Many have guidelines, not bans. Show academic examples.

**Q: "How accurate is AI-generated content?"**
A: Varies by task. Always verify facts, especially citations and statistics.

### Timing Flexibility Guide

#### If Running Behind:
- Skip second demo in Module 1
- Reduce Module 2 synthesis to 15 minutes
- Combine Module 4 workflow activities

#### If Running Ahead:
- Add peer teaching moments
- Explore advanced features briefly
- Extra Q&A within modules

### Post-Workshop Support Structure

1. **Immediate:** Resource package email
2. **Week 1:** Tips email series (daily)
3. **Week 2:** Check-in survey
4. **Week 4:** Optional follow-up session
5. **Ongoing:** Community Slack access

### Key Metrics to Track

#### During Workshop:
- Exercise completion rates
- Chat engagement level
- Technical issue frequency
- Breakout room participation

#### Post-Workshop:
- Tool adoption rates
- Success story collection
- Community engagement
- Follow-up session attendance

### Facilitator Energy Management

- **High Energy Needed:** Opening, exercise launches
- **Moderate Energy:** Demonstrations, transitions
- **Lower Energy OK:** Individual work time
- **Re-energize Points:** After break, final module

### Emergency Protocols

#### Technical Failures:
1. Participant can't access tool → Provide backup account
2. Screen share fails → Switch to backup presenter
3. Internet issues → Record and share asynchronously

#### Content Issues:
1. Exercise too hard → Provide simplified version
2. Time running out → Prioritize core exercises
3. Confusion widespread → Pause and clarify

### Final Facilitator Reminders

1. **You're a guide, not a guru** - Participants are experts in their research
2. **Progress over perfection** - Some output better than none
3. **Energy is contagious** - Your enthusiasm drives engagement
4. **Every question is valid** - No AI shaming
5. **End with momentum** - They should leave excited to try tools

### Success Visualization
By 12:00 PM, every participant will:
- Have AI-generated content for their research
- Feel confident using at least one new tool
- Have a clear next step planned
- Be excited about possibilities
- Join a supportive community

Remember: This workshop launches journeys, not destinations.
