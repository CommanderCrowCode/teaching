# Overall themes of the class
Overall, the class should aim to instill in the students the following key message:

"Thinking about problems mathematically allows one to think better. If one thinks better, one will make better decisions in life, which lead to a more successful and fulfilling life".

Additionally, three specific characteristics of mathematics:
1. Mathematics allow one to identify ambiguous / under-defined questions.
2. Mathematics is impartial when applied correctly (despite having to deal with the uncertainty of the real world)
3. Mathematical answers are reusable. This means that students don't necessarily need to understand how a formula was derived, as long as they can use it. For example, using a pre-made NPV calculator or applying rule of 72 requires a lot less mathematical knowledge than deriving it in the first place.
