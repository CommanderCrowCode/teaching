#### Paper 2: Foundational (Large, Older Node)
- **Title:** _________________________________
- **Authors/Year:** _________________________________
- **Why Selected:** Theoretical importance, field-defining
- **Key Contribution:** _________________________________
- **Relevance to Your Work:** _________________________________

#### Paper 3: Recent Breakthrough (Dark Node, Last 2 Years)
- **Title:** _________________________________
- **Authors/Year:** _________________________________
- **Why Selected:** Recent high impact, novel approach
- **Key Contribution:** _________________________________
- **Relevance to Your Work:** _________________________________

#### Paper 4: Recent Development (Dark Node, Last 2 Years)
- **Title:** _________________________________

### Visual Selection Guide

Look for these patterns in your graph:

```
üîµ Large Nodes = Highly cited, foundational
üü¢ Dark Nodes = Recent publications
üü° Central Position = Core to field
üî¥ Bridge Position = Interdisciplinary
üìç Cluster Formation = Research communities
```

## Exercise 3: AI-Powered Literature Synthesis (20 minutes)

### Part A: Gather Abstracts (5 minutes)

1. Copy abstracts from 3 of your selected papers
2. Paste into a working document
3. Include paper titles and authors

### Part B: Generate Synthesis (10 minutes)

#### Synthesis Prompt Template
```
I have three research paper abstracts below. Please synthesize them into a coherent narrative about [YOUR RESEARCH TOPIC]. 

Structure your response to:
1. Identify the overarching theme connecting these works
2. Highlight areas of agreement between papers
3. Note any contradictions or debates
4. Identify research gaps not addressed
5. Suggest how these gaps relate to [YOUR SPECIFIC RESEARCH QUESTION]

Use academic writing style with in-text citations (Author, Year).
Length: 200-250 words

Abstract 1: [PASTE]
Abstract 2: [PASTE]
Abstract 3: [PASTE]
```

### Part C: Refine and Personalize (5 minutes)

#### Refinement Prompts
1. "Add a sentence about methodological approaches used"
2. "Strengthen the connection to [your theoretical framework]"
3. "Make the research gap more specific to [your context]"
4. "Add potential implications for [your field/application]"

### Your Synthesis Output

**Initial AI Synthesis:**
_________________________________
_________________________________
_________________________________

**Your Refined Version:**
_________________________________
_________________________________
_________________________________

**How This Connects to Your Research:**

## Advanced Strategies

### Reading the Connected Papers Visualization

#### Node Analysis
- **Size** = Citation count (influence)
- **Color** = Publication year (recency)
- **Position** = Conceptual similarity
- **Lines** = Citation relationships

#### Pattern Recognition
1. **Dense Clusters** = Mature research areas
2. **Sparse Areas** = Opportunity gaps
3. **Bridge Papers** = Interdisciplinary potential
4. **Isolated Nodes** = Unique approaches

### Literature Mapping Strategies

#### For Literature Reviews
1. Start with seminal work
2. Trace forward to recent developments
3. Identify parallel research streams
4. Find methodological innovations

#### For Gap Identification
1. Look for sparse graph areas
2. Find disconnected clusters
3. Identify missing connections
4. Note temporal gaps

#### For Interdisciplinary Work
1. Select papers from different clusters
2. Find bridge papers
3. Explore peripheral nodes
4. Connect disparate fields

### Integration with Your Research

#### Questions to Consider
- Which cluster does your work fit into?
- What connections are missing?
- Which methods could you adapt?
- What debates can you contribute to?

#### Next Steps
- [ ] Create graphs for 3-5 key papers
- [ ] Build a citation network map
- [ ] Identify 10 must-read papers
- [ ] Plan systematic review strategy
- [ ] Set up citation alerts

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Can't Find Your Paper?
- Try searching by DOI
- Use Google Scholar to find DOI
- Check spelling and special characters
- Try alternative paper from same authors

### Graph Too Complex?
- Focus on top 10 nodes
- Use Prior/Derivative toggle
- Screenshot specific clusters
- Work with sub-sections

### No Clear Patterns?
- Your field may be emerging
- Try older seed paper
- Look for review papers
- Consider broader search terms

### Time Management Tips
- Set timer for each section
- Don't read full papers now
- Focus on patterns, not details
- Save deep reading for later
