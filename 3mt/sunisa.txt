The number of tourists is slightly increased every year, because... maaf... ...because of the increasing demand of aquatic animal consumption as well. ...and pollution and climate change problem and trawl fishing in the past in Phuket. As a result, coastal ecosystems are affected, affecting the degradation of coastal fishery resources. Last one, catching aquatic animals from nature beyond production potential, causing the number of aquatic animals to decrease. Consequently, affecting the life and livelihood of local fishermen and people in the coastal area. And how is this research different from other research? At present, fish aggregating devices are set up to increase the fishermen's catch, but found that the material used in the construction may pollute the environment. Therefore, in order to reduce the potential impact on the environment using natural material to build a fish aggregating device is another option to help reduce the pollution impact caused by the fish aggregating device placement. However, there is no definitive study data on the benefits of fish aggregating devices using natural materials that is related to the abundance of aquatic animals. Next. Objective of this thesis is, one, to study the biodiversity of aquatic animals around the fish aggregating device. Two, to compare the quantity and species of aquatic animals before and after placing the fish aggregating device and to know the economic and social impact of placing fish aggregating device. Thank you very much. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Okay. Okay, so any questions? The idea of using biodegradable material for marine life cover is, I think, a very good one, because in intertidal communities, most of the food chain is actually a detrital food chain. It's a breakdown of wood and leaves and things like that. And so, actually, a biodegradable fish habitat is actually a pretty good idea, because it'll get broken down and eaten by all sorts of nice little animals like crabs and fish and things like that. So, actually, the idea is a good one compared to using concrete blocks and things like that. Okay. Basically, it's a good idea, and I hope it works out well. Thank you. Thank you very much. I have one question, because I'm always wondering about this aggregating device. I have seen a seaweed community, and they use some sort of bamboo and some other trees, some sort of special trees, leaves or something. But in India, you use something like coconut leaves or something. So, is there any research on this, which kind of plant or which kind of trees, which are the best? Or how does it work? I'm wondering about it. Well, in marine habitats, there's a lot of cellulose-digesting fungi and bacteria. And so, there shouldn't be any problem with them breaking down, because, after all, there's mangrove leaves and mangrove sticks and all that sort of stuff being continuously produced by the mangrove swamps. So, that's why I said that it's important that you're actually putting stuff into the... So, it's actually a pretty good idea. Your artificial cement blocks with plastic in them would not be a good idea. It would not be a good idea. Okay. That's okay. Okay. Professor Ray already answered Professor Pakorn's question. So, do you want to add some more ideas or some more answers? Can I answer in Thai? Yes, but we don't have much time. Okay. Okay. Okay, thank you very much. Sunisa, so, next time, maybe you will try to answer in English, okay? Okay.
