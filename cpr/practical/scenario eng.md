The content of the PDF titled "Scenario" pertains to a simulation exercise for first-year university students at Prince of Songkla University, focusing on emergency response, specifically Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) and Automated External Defibrillator (AED) usage. Here's the translated content, preserving the table structure as much as possible:
