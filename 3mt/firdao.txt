Y'all, are you ready? Hello. You sure? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Hello, everyone. My name is Phitdao Sinmat. My topic, electric fusion, electrofusion of orchid protoparts using combination of combination for power electric field to in-heart production volume. Advisor is Dr. Sachin Buntawin and Dr. Raymond James Richet. Next, objective, study of how condition for electrofusion of protoparts, deformasome and cephalosodium. Concern parameter, one. Solution, concertation. Two, conductivity. Three, electric field. Four, number of power. Two, development of multimode power electric field for deformasome and cephalosodium. Next, current technique for breeding flower plant. One, selection of plant valentines to gamma ray tree using chemical to combine protoparts. Electro-magnetic can be filled one plant at a time. Next, along time sequence expertise. Reverb technique of protoparts fusion means mass electrofusion, electric surcharge of fusion mean. The fusion time is reduced. Next, this is a prototype tool for implementation. Next, this is a tool for using protopart, simulate of protopart activity with electrode. This is a simulation of the combination of two protopart to form hybrid cell. This is the study of cell longitude relation to duration dendrobium mesofill to determinant actin of cell fusion. Next, result from work. Standard of factor of protopart, accretion, simulate, define, electric field. Sorry. Sorry, please try to wrap up. The time is already up, so can you move to the next slide or try to conclude your research, please? Yes, again, now consult to. We have been about to implement with cultivating orchid seed and leaf and we are study electrical technique to use time to combine protopart. Thank you very much. That's all? Yes. Okay, thank you very much. So, any question?
