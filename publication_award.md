# Publication Reward System at Prince of Songkla University

Based on the provided announcements from Prince of Songkla University regarding academic publication compensation (2564 BE with 2565 BE amendment), here's how you can earn publication rewards as a full-time lecturer:

## Eligibility

You qualify as "university staff" (พนักงานมหาวิทยาลัย) if you are paid from either the university budget or work income. The system applies to academic positions including Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor.

## Publication Types That Qualify

Your publications must fall into one of these categories:

1. **Research papers** published in academic journals listed in:
   - **International databases**: ERIC, MathSciNet, Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science (SCIE, SSCI, AHCI), JSTOR, Project Muse
   - **National databases**: Thai Journal Citation Index (TCI) Group 1 journals

2. **Creative works** in visual arts, applied arts, architecture, music, performing arts, and other creative works that follow university criteria.

## Scoring System

Each publication earns base points based on database quality:
- Web of Science (SCIE, SSCI, AHCI only): **1.00 point**
- Other international databases: **0.75 points**
- National databases (TCI Group 1): **0.50 points**

## Authorship Weights

Your role in the publication affects the weight applied to your base score:
- First author AND Corresponding author: **1.25**
- First author OR Corresponding author: **1.00**
- Co-author: **0.25** (updated in 2565 BE announcement)

## Calculation Formula

Your total score = Base points × Authorship weight

For example:
- If you're first author on a Web of Science paper: 1.00 × 1.00 = 1.00
- If you're both first and corresponding author on a Scopus paper: 0.75 × 1.25 = 0.94
- If you're a co-author on a TCI Group 1 paper: 0.50 × 0.25 = 0.13
