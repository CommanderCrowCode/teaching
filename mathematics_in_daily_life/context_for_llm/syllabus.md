**(Official) Class description**  
Ratios, percentage, financial mathematics, basic statistics and their applications for everyday life

**Overall Course Objectives**    
The aim is to provide a firm grounding in the application of mathematical and statistical concepts that are commonly used in daily life.   

**Expected Learning Outcomes**    
At the end of the course, students are expected to comprehend: 

1. basic ideas of applying mathematics and statistics in daily life, percentage & charts, basic statistics in the context of descriptive statistics, simple linear regression, time series and forecasting  
2. have developed skills on:   
   1. Using the relation and graphs to apply to the real life problem.    
   2. Calculate Percentage & chart.   
   3. Performing basic statistical procedures using descriptive statistics   
   4. applying basic concepts of simple linear regression, time series, probability, and forecasting to real life problems.   
   5. using an appropriate statistical package if time is permitted.   
      

**Required material**: LMS

**Class format**  
Weekly assignments will be posted on Mondays on the week that we have a lecture.

In the class, the instructor will focus on asking questions related to the materials to build up the concepts for that week. Some examples similar to the ones students might see in the assignment will be worked out together. Some problems from last week's homework might be discussed.

However, do not expect that the lecture is everything. Usually, students tend to do better if they do more research on the topic of the week. Suggested sources for further research will be provided. These will be optional to the class. But they are strongly encouraged, as they will build up your background of being a life-long learner who thinks quantitatively.

**Plagiarism/Cheating**  
Plagiarism/Cheating are in no way acceptable. Any violations have the following consequence

1. Students will be informed both verbally and through a written notice about the violations. Students will have one chance to explain themselves and correct the problem.  
2. A second violation from the same student or a refusal to correct the first violation will result in automatic failure from the class.  
3. Any disputes with the instructor will be arbitrated by a panel of three PSU Phuket lecturers of the student’s choosing.

**Assessment methods**

- Weekly assignments: These are assignments assigned weekly. The assignments will check students’ understanding of the topic discussed that week. All weekly assignments are equally weighted.  
- Take-home exams: There are two take-home exams: midterm and final. This will be a long-form exam in which you will have to do calculations, do additional research, and use additional tools (Google Sheets, MS Excel etc.). These exams will test your overall ability to integrate and apply what you have learned.


**Grade distribution**  
	Weekly assignments				40%  
	Midterm exam					20%  
	Final exam					40%

Non-participation in any assignments will result in zero grade for that particular assignment.  
Final exam is cumulative.

**Grading**  
	No curve. All grades will be rounded to the nearest integer with half a percent being rounded up as one, e.g. 74.5% \-\> 75%.  
	A		90% or above  
	B+		85% \- 89%  
B		80% \- 84%  
	C+		75% \- 80%  
C		70% \- 74%  
	D+		60% \- 69%  
	D		50% \- 59%  
E		49% or under, Failing

**Grading dispute**  
If a mistake is found in any grading & returned assignment, a student has a period of one week after the test/assignment is returned to bring it up to the instructor. A written explanation of why she thinks the grading is incorrect is to be submitted with the test/assignment. A re-grade will be done. The re-grade is final and no second dispute will be accepted. 

Mistakes in the LMS gradebook can also only be corrected if the original work is presented. If the original work is done online, the copy on LMS as stored by the university is considered the only legitimate copy.

After one week, except for extraordinary circumstances, the grade is considered final and can no longer be changed for any reason, not even for errors in grading.

**Attendance**  
Attendance is required. If a student decides to miss a class, it is her own responsibility to hand in any assignments on time and follow up with class material. With the exception of rare cases, there will not be a make-up class.

If a student does not attend at least 80% of the class, the student is not eligible to take the final test.

In the cases that the instructor has to miss classes, enough reading material will be provided for the students to follow the same schedule posted on LMS.

Any changes to the schedule will be announced through LMS.
