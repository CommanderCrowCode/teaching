# Student body description
The students attending the "Mathematics in Daily Life" (MDL) class are freshmen at Prince of Songkla University, Phuket campus.

Most students are from the Faculty of Hospitality and Tourism, and College of Computing. They are unlikely to be STEM students or have a strong grasp of mathematics. 

If the content of the class has something to do with managing hospitality and services businesses, it will resonate with the students better. Entrepreneurship resonates as well. However, these should be use as pedagogical tools instead of the main focus of the class.
