## 🚨 Critical Rules:

<v-clicks>

1. **Always disclose AI use** in methods/acknowledgments
2. **Verify all AI-generated content** - it can hallucinate
3. **Maintain your voice** - AI assists, doesn't replace
4. **Check journal policies** - requirements vary
5. **Never upload sensitive data** - protect privacy

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

## ✅ Best Practices:
- Use AI for first drafts, human expertise for final
- Cross-check citations and statistics
- Keep a log of AI tools used
- Stay updated on institutional policies
