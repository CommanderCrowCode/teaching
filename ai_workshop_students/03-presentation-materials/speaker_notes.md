## Module 1: AI Writing Assistants (9:10-10:00 AM)

### Slide 7: Module 1 Overview
**Say:** "Let's dive into AI writing assistants. How many of you have stared at a blank page, knowing what you want to say but struggling to start? That ends today."

**Energy:** High enthusiasm, this sets the tone

### Slide 8: ChatGPT vs Claude
**Say:** "Think of ChatGPT as your brainstorming buddy - great for initial ideas and broad knowledge. Claude is your detail-oriented colleague - excellent for nuanced academic writing. Let me show you exactly what I mean..."

### Slide 9: Live Demo Screen
**Do:** Split screen demonstration
**Say:** "Watch what happens when I give both the same prompt about explaining p-values..."

**Key Points:**
- Note ChatGPT's conversational style
- Highlight Claude's precision
- Both are valuable for different tasks

### Slide 10: The Prompt Formula
**Say:** "Here's the secret sauce - it's not about complex prompts, it's about complete prompts. Context tells AI who you are, Task is what you need, Format is how you want it, and Constraints keep it focused."

**Example:** Walk through each component slowly

### Slide 11: Weak vs Strong Prompts
**Say:** "This is the difference between a frustrating experience and magic. Look at these two prompts..."

**Emphasize:** Specificity is your friend

### Slide 12: Exercise 1 Instructions
**Say:** "Your turn! Take your research question and transform it into three different prompts. Use the template in your materials. I'll be here if you get stuck."

**Do:**
- Start 10-minute timer
- Monitor chat for questions
- Offer encouragement

**2-minute warning:** "Great work! Two minutes left - pick your favorite prompt to share."

### Slide 13: Exercise 2 Instructions
**Say:** "Now for the real magic - let's generate an abstract for your current work. Remember, this is a draft to refine, not submit as-is."

**Remind:** "Include all four sections: background, methods, results, implications."

**During exercise:**
- "I'm seeing great progress in the chat!"
- "Remember, you can tell AI to 'make it more academic' or 'add more detail about X'"
- "If you're stuck, try starting with 'I need a 200-word abstract for...'"

### Slide 14: Breakout Room Instructions
**Say:** "Time to learn from each other. I'm sending you to breakout rooms of 2-3 people. Share your abstract, give one specific compliment and one constructive suggestion. You have 3 minutes - go!"

**After breakout:** "Welcome back! What surprised you about your peer's abstract?"

### Slide 15: Exercise 3 Instructions
**Say:** "Final exercise for Module 1 - let's tackle literature synthesis. This is where AI truly shines, helping you see connections across papers."

**Tip:** "Pro tip: Always tell AI to maintain citations in the format you need."

## Module 2: Smart Literature Discovery (10:00-10:50 AM)

### Slide 16: Module 2 Overview
**Say:** "How many hours have you spent down research rabbit holes, wondering if you've found all the relevant papers? Connected Papers is about to change that."

**Hook:** "What if you could see your entire research landscape in one visualization?"

### Slide 17: Connected Papers Interface
**Say:** "Don't let the visualization overwhelm you - it's actually quite simple once you know what to look for..."

**Do:** Use annotation tool to highlight each feature

### Slide 18: Reading the Research Map
**Say:** "Big circles are highly cited papers - these are your field's foundations. Thick lines mean strong relationships. And see these colors? Darker means older, lighter means newer. It's like a family tree for research!"

### Slide 19: Strategic Approaches
**Say:** "There are three ways to use this tool, depending on your goal..."

**Explain each with enthusiasm:**
- Seminal: "Start with the classic everyone cites"
- Recent: "Start with that hot new paper"
- Gap: "Look for sparse areas - that's opportunity!"

### Slide 20: Exercise 1 Instructions
**Say:** "Let's create your first map. Enter your seed paper - this could be your favorite paper, your own publication, or that paper you always cite."

**Troubleshooting ready:**
- "If you can't find your paper, try the DOI"
- "No access? Use one of our backup papers listed in chat"

### Slide 21: Paper Selection Criteria
**Say:** "Now, don't try to read everything! Be strategic. You want a mix - foundations to understand the history, recent work to see where the field is going, and bridge papers that connect different areas."

### Slide 22: Exercise 2 Instructions
**Say:** "From your map, select 5 papers using our criteria. This isn't random - you're building your reading list strategically."

**Encourage:** "Trust your instincts. If a paper's position intrigues you, investigate!"

### Slide 23: AI Synthesis Process
**Say:** "Here's where we connect Module 1 skills with Module 2 discoveries. We'll use AI to help us understand how these papers relate."

### Slide 24: Exercise 3 Instructions
**Say:** "This is my favorite exercise - watch how AI can help you see patterns across papers you might have missed."

**Key reminder:** "Always verify AI's interpretation, but use it as your starting point."

## Break (10:50-11:00 AM)

### Slide 25: Break Time
**Say:** "Excellent work, everyone! We're two-thirds through, and you've already created real research content. Take 10 minutes to stretch, grab water, and reset. We'll dive into data analysis at 11:00 sharp."

**Do:**
- Start break timer
